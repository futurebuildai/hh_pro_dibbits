/**
 * The first save must be COMPLETE.
 *
 * `attachPersistence` writes on CHANGE, which never happens to the seeded
 * stores — so a fresh demo left `projects`, `orders`, and `scope` absent from
 * localStorage while `customerQuotes` and `activity` were written the moment
 * the contractor did anything. A second tab then loaded a save carrying a
 * customer quote but no core trio, failed the trio check in `restorePersisted`,
 * reseeded from scratch (which has no customer quotes), and the share link
 * opened on "This link is no longer valid" — the two-window accept demo, broken
 * on every fresh install.
 *
 * It self-healed on any reload of the contractor tab, which is why it survived
 * so long unnoticed.
 *
 * NOTHING HERE MAY CALL `flushPersistence()`. It writes EVERY attached store
 * unconditionally, so calling it manufactures exactly the complete save this
 * file exists to prove we write on our own — the first version of these tests
 * passed with the bug reintroduced for precisely that reason. The browser only
 * flushes on `pagehide`; during a live session a store reaches disk only when
 * it CHANGES, which is the whole point.
