/**
 * The rules that decide whether a card may move between board columns.
 *
 * Two product principles drive every rule here:
 *
 * 1. The contractor is in control. Dragging a card does something real; the
 *    system only blocks a move when it genuinely cannot be honoured, and when
 *    it blocks it says why in words the contractor would use. Every rejection
 *    string here is shown verbatim in the UI and handed verbatim to the AI.
 *
 * 2. The quote desk is a gate, not a toll booth. An order that is fully priced
 *    by the ERP may go straight Plan -> Order: that is the whole promise of
 *    account pricing, and forcing everyone through a sales desk would recreate
 *    the friction this product exists to remove. But an order containing a
 *    special-order line has no real price, so it MUST be quoted first --
 *    otherwise the contractor is committing to a number nobody has stood behind.
