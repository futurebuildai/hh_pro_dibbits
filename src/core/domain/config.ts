 * PUBLIC: it is injected into the page and readable by anyone using the app,
 * because it is branding, terms, and feature flags. The LLM credential is NOT
 * part of this type at all — it lives only in the server's private store and
 * has no representation here beyond `assistant.hasCredential`. That is
 * deliberate: a shape that cannot carry the secret cannot leak it.
 *
 * This module is framework-free and pure so the same validation runs in the
 * admin UI (immediate feedback) and on the server (the actual gate). The
 * server never trusts the client's validation — it re-runs this.
