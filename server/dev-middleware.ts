/**
 * Put our API routes in the one slot in Vite's stack that actually works.
 *
 * There are two constraints and they pull in opposite directions:
 *
 *  - AFTER `viteHostCheckMiddleware`, or a DNS-rebinding page reaches the
 *    admin API with `isLoopback` satisfied — under that attack the TCP peer
 *    genuinely is 127.0.0.1. Registering inside the `configureServer` body
 *    puts middleware in FRONT of the host check, so that is not an option.
 *
 *  - BEFORE `viteHtmlFallbackMiddleware`, which REWRITES `req.url` to
 *    `/index.html` for any request whose `Accept` contains `text/html` or
 *    `*​/*`. Connect matches routes on `req.url`, so after that rewrite
 *    `/api/admin/state` no longer matches `/api/admin` and the request sails
 *    past every API handler into the SPA.
 *
 * Returning a post-hook from `configureServer` satisfies the first and
 * violates the second, which is what shipped: the whole dev API surface —
 * health, config, the Claude proxy, and the entire admin console — answered
 * `200 <!doctype html>` to anything sent with a browser's default `Accept`.
 * Nothing caught it because `fetch()` from the SDK sets
 * `Accept: application/json` and kept working, and because every check we had
 * asserted on STATUS: the SPA fallback answers 200, so "200 means mounted" was
 * never true. Only driving the real server with a real `Accept` header showed
 * it.
 *
 * So: register in the post-hook, then move the layers to sit immediately
 * before the HTML fallback. Both constraints hold, and the reorder is asserted
 * rather than assumed — if a Vite upgrade renames these internals the dev
 * server refuses to start instead of silently serving a dead API again.
