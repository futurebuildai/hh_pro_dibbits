/**
 * Streaming passthrough to the Anthropic Messages API.
 *
 * Two ways a request gets a key, in precedence order:
 *
 * 1. **Bring-your-own-key**, forwarded by the browser in `x-anthropic-byok`.
 *    A developer pastes their own key in the UI; it rides same-origin to here
 *    and no further. Routing BYOK through the proxy rather than letting the
 *    browser call Anthropic directly is the point — the model allowlist, the
 *    max_tokens ceiling, the rate limit, and abort propagation all still apply
 *    to a request the user paid for.
 * 2. **The server's own ANTHROPIC_API_KEY**, which never reaches the browser.
 *    The client sends a placeholder in `x-api-key`; this swaps in the real one.
 *
 * Either way the SSE bytes are piped straight back. A forwarded key is used
 * for exactly one upstream call and is never stored, echoed, or logged.
 *
 * `proxyClaude` is deliberately host-agnostic — it takes a body and a key and
 * returns a web `Response`, so any runtime (Node, edge, worker) can wrap it.
 * Today the only caller is the Vite dev middleware below; the production host
 * is undecided (not Vercel). Keep it that way until the host is chosen.
