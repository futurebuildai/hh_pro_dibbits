/**
 * Security smoke test against a REAL dev server.
 *
 * Every assertion here corresponds to a vulnerability that was actually
 * present and verified during review, not a hypothetical:
 *
 *  - `.hhpro/secrets.json` was served over HTTP with no auth, handing out
 *    the dealer's Anthropic key to anyone who guessed the path.
 *  - The API middleware registered ahead of Vite's DNS-rebinding defence, so a
 *    forged Host header reached the key-spending proxy and the admin API.
 *
 * These cannot be unit-tested: both are properties of how middleware composes
 * inside a running Vite server.
